Machine Learning Engineer,"The Rockefeller University is the world's leading biomedical research University. Our groundbreaking discoveries in basic and clinical research are transforming medicine. We share a singular commitment to advancing science for the benefit of humanity. Our collaborative culture drives each of us to achieve a higher level, fueling the breakthroughs for which we are known. 
Many of our most sophisticated cognitive abilities are thought to have evolved to subserve social interactions, yet the underlying computations that make these interactions possible, in all their complexity and nuance, remain elusive. The Price Family Center for the Social Brain (PFCSB) at The Rockefeller University was therefore established to map the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms of social behavior and to use these insights to forge new links between basic and applied neuroscience, with the ultimate goal to alleviate impairments of social brain function. Central to the PFCSB's ambitious goal is to leverage and build on recent advances in AI-based Computer Vision technologies to characterize the detailed behavioral dynamics of interacting pairs and populations of animals. The Data Science Resource Center (DSRC) at The Rockefeller University will work in close collaboration with Price Center scientists to advance these research objectives with the development of novel machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) algorithms that can shed light on the fundamental building blocks of social behaviors. The newly-created Data Science Resource Center (DSRC) is responsible for supporting and advancing the research objectives of The Rockefeller University's faculty and staff.
We are seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join our team!
The PositionThe PFCSB aims to elucidate the neural and behavioral algorithms of social behavior across a wide array of species, from ants and flies to songbirds and primates. Fulfilling this mission will require, among many innovations, the development and implementation of powerful technologies to study neural activity in socially interacting animals, in real time.
Reporting to Dr. Paolo Emilio Barbano, Director of the DSC and advised by Dr. Vanessa Ruta, Director of the PFCSB, the ideal candidate will work in close collaboration with neuroscientists across nine core labs to research, develop and implement innovative approaches and create end-to-end pipelines to detect, track and analyze the behavior of animals both in controlled laboratory settings and in more complex natural landscapes.
We welcome applications from creative, highly motivated, and ambitious candidates interested in pursuing projects based on their own ideas or within the existing lines of work at the interface of experimental and computational system neuroscience.
Responsibilities include:Research, implement, and deploy state-of-the-art CV algorithms and systems for the identification, tracking and analysis of animal behaviorBuild prototypes and explore conceptually innovative solutionsWork at creating CV and predictive ML workflows in close collaboration with members of the nine laboratories that form the core of the PFCSB (Dr. Vanessa Ruta, Laboratory of Neurophysiology and Behavior, Dr. Winrich Freiwald, Laboratory of Neural Systems, Dr. Cori Bargmann, Lulu and Anthony Wang Laboratory of Neural Circuits and Behavior, Dr. Leslie Vosshall, Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior, Dr. Erich Jarvis, Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language, Dr. Priya Rajasethupathy, Laboratory of Neural Dynamics and Cognition, Dr. Alipasha Vaziri, Laboratory of Neurotechnology and Biophysics, and Dr. Michael Young, Laboratory of Genetics) Other duties and special projects as assigned.

About Us
At Ginnie Mae, we help make housing a reality for millions of households across America and veterans by channeling global capital into the nation's housing markets. Specifically, the Ginnie Mae guaranty allows mortgage lenders to obtain a better price for their mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. The lenders can then use the proceeds to make new mortgage loans available. Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Therefore, Ginnie Mae's balance sheet doesn't use derivatives to hedge or carry long term debt. What Ginnie Mae does is guarantee investors the timely payment of principal and interest on MBS backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans — mainly loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Other guarantors or issuers of loans eligible as collateral for Ginnie Mae MBS include the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development (RD) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH). Ginnie Mae securities are the only MBS to carry the full faith and credit guaranty of the United States government, which means that even in difficult times, an investment in Ginnie Mae MBS is one of the safest an investor can make.",Business Analysis,"['data analysis', 'business analysis', 'mortgage backed securities', 'loan securitization', 'secondary mortgage market', 'program development', 'IT budgeting', 'scheduling']","['GS-14', 'Specialized Experience: GS-13 level in the Federal service', 'One year of specialized experience at a level of difficulty and responsibility equivalent to the GS-13 grade level in the Federal service', 'Working with mortgage backed securities including mortgage origination, servicing, loan securitization, and the secondary mortgage market', 'Conducting business analyses to identify alternative approaches to implementing new programs, products, and identifying enhancements to existing business processes', 'Preparing recommendations to senior management as to best implementation approach']"

Focus on ML forecasting, Python and Hadoop. Experience with Python, ARIMA, FB Prophet, Seasonal Naive, Gluon.Data Science Innovation (DSI) is a very unique application. It is truly ML-driven at its heart and our forecasting models originally looked singularly at cash balance forecasting. That has all changed as we have now incorporated approximately 100 additional financial metrics from our new DSI Metrics Farm. This allows future model executions to become a Universal Forecasting Model instead of being limited to just cash forecasting. It’s a very exciting application, especially since the models have been integrated within a Marketplace concept UI that allows Subscriber/Contributor functionality to make information and processing more personal and with greater extensibility across the enterprise. The application architecture is represented by OpenShift, Linux, Oracle, SQL Server, Hadoop, MongoDB, APIs, and a great deal of Python code.Describe the current initiatives that this resource will be impacting:Working toward implementation of Machine Learning Services.Team Background and Preferred Candidate History:Do you only want candidates with a similar background or would you like to see candidates with a diverse industry background?Diverse industry background, finance background preferred.
